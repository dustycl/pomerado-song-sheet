title: Praise the Lord O My Soul
---
Praise the Lord, O my soul,\
All my inmost being praise his name\
Praise the Lord, O my soul,\
And forget not all his benefits,\
O my soul.

He forgives all of your sin\
Lifts you up out of the pit\
Satisfies you with good things\
You can fly on eagle's wings

Slow to anger full of love\
High as heaven up above\
Far as East is from the West\
So removed is sin from us

He knows we are only dust\
Treats us as adopted ones\
In a short time we'll be gone\
But his love will carry on

Praise the Lord, he rules us all\
Praise the Lord in heaven strong\
Praise the Lord, each angel song\
All creation, sing along
