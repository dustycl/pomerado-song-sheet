title: Be with Me Lord
---
Sometimes I feel
That I could fight an army
With just me and you, 
And there’s no one could harm me.
O, but sometimes I
Can feel a little shy.
It’s then I need to know 
That you are there, that’s why I’m singing

Be with me Lord
Be with me Lord
Be with me Lord
Be with me, be with me, Be with me Lord

I know you said
That I would not be tested 
More than I could bear
And that you’d have my best in mind.
With everything 
That ever comes my way,
I know you’re in control
So hear me as I pray.  I’m singing…

Now help me, Lord
To share what I’ve been given.
Help me make a difference 
With this life I’m living.
As I show my neighbor
Where true treasure’s stored,
Help me know you promised
You’d be with me Lord.  I’m singing…
