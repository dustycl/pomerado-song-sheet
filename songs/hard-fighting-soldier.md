Lord I'm a hard fighting soldier\
On the battlefield\
Lord I'm a hard fighting soldier\
On the battlefield\
Lord I'm a hard fighting soldier\
On the battlefield\
Keep on bringing souls to Jesus by the service that I yield

I've got a helmet on my head\
And in my hand a sword and shield\
I've got a helmet on my head\
And in my hand a sword and shield\
I've got a helmet on my head\
And in my hand a sword and shield\
Keep on bringing souls to Jesus\
By the service that I yield

You've gotta walk right and talk right\
And sing right and pray right on the battlefield\
You've gotta walk right and talk right\

You know that Jesus is my captain\
And He fights my battles still\
He has never lost a battle\
And I know He never will\
I got the word for my sword\
And I got faith for my shield\
Keep on bringing souls to Jesus\
By the service that I yield

And when I did let me die\
In the service of the Lord\
And when I did let me die\
In the service of the Lord\
And when I did let me die\
In the service of the Lord\
Keep on bringing souls to Jesus\
By the service that I yield
