title: Anchor for the Soul
---
Anchor for the soul,\
Shelter from the storm;\
Thunder and the lightning\
Can be very fright'ning,\
But God is in control.

Anchor for the soul,\
Shelter from the storm;\
Manna in the morning,\
Blessings overflowing,\
Leading us to home.

This world's not my home,\
Just a-passing through.\
Through this life I wander,\
Treasure stored up yonder\
Somewhere beyond the blue.

On my way I learn\
Through each path I take.\
Every day I'm growing,\
On my way I'm knowing\
Heaven's worth the wait.\

When the day is gone,\
When my journey ends,\
Won't be nothing better\
Then to be together\
With all my faithful friends.

We'll all join in song\
Gathered 'round the throne.\
There'll be no more sorrow\
Someday when tomorrow\
Heaven is our home.
