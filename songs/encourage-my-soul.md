Encourage My Soul

Encourage my soul and let us journey on
For the night is dark, and I am far from home
Thanks be to God, the morning light appears

The storm is passing over,
The storm is passing over,
The storm is passing over, Hallelu!

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
The storm is passing over,
The storm is passing over,
The storm is passing over, Hallelu!
