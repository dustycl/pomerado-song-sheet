title: A Faithful Witness
---
Amazing grace how sweet the sound\
I once was lost but now I′m found\
I once was blind but now I see\
I've got to share what you′ve done for me\
Turned my darkness in to light\
You turned my blindness in to sight\
I can't help speaking to the world\
Of what I've seen and heard

A faithful witness is what You′re seeking\
I can't help speaking what You′ve done for me\
Of all You gave me\
Of how You saved me\
A faithful witness I will be

My hope is built on nothing less\
Than Jesus′ blood and righteousness\
On Christ the solid rock I stand\
All other ground is sinking sand\
I′ll live my life so others know\
The choices that I make will show\
That I've been giv′n eternal life\
It's worth all sacrifice

I took my savior's hand\
He showed He had a plan\
To snatch me from the flame\
And give me a new name\
Though I'd been trapped in sin\
My life begun again\
Now that I′ve been set free\
He′s calling me to be
