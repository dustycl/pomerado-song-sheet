title: Stand in Awe

Stand in awe; Your power and Your glory!\
Stand in awe, with trembling and fear!\
Stand in awe, You're sovereign and You're holy!\
Lord O God, we stand in awe!

Your deeds, Your Name, Your works of creation;\
Your love, Your law, Your plan of salvation;\
The stars seem unnumbered\
The lightning, the thunder\
The universe under Your reign

Stand in awe; Your power and Your glory!\
Stand in awe, with trembling and fear!\
Stand in awe, You're sovereign and You're holy!\
Lord O God, we stand in awe!

We stand with Christ as Your holy nation;\
We take Your word to our generation.\
Your hand is upon us,\
Your Spirit within us,\
and hell can't prevent us, we've won!\
We've won!

Stand in awe; Your power and Your glory!\
Stand in awe, with trembling and fear!\
Stand in awe, You're sovereign and You're holy!\
Lord O God, Lord O God,\
Lord O God, we stand in awe!
