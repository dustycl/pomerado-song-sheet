title: There's Not a Friend
---
There’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus,\
No not one, no not one\
None else can heal all our soul’s diseases,\
No not one, no not one

Jesus knows all about our struggles\
He will guide ‘till the day is done\
There’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus,\
No not one, no not one

No friend like him is so high and holy\
No not one, no not one\
And yet no friend is so meek and lowly\
No not one, no not one

There’s not and hour that he is not near us\
No not one, no not one\
No night so dark, but his love can cheer us\
No not one, no not one
