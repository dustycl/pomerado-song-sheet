title: Lead Me to the Rock
---
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I,\
higher than I, higher than I.\
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I,\
You're my tower against the foe.

Hear my cry O God,\
answer my prayer

I'll take refuge in\
the shelter of your wings

I'll fulfill my vows\
day after day
