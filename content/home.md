      Unto Thee, O Lord\
      Do I lift up my soul\
      Unto Thee, O Lord\
      Do I lift up my soul

      O my God, I trust in Thee\
      O let me not be ashamed,\
      Let not my enemies\
      triumph over me

      Let none that wait\
      on Thee be ashamed\
      Let none that wait\
      on Thee be ashamed

      Remember not \
      The sins of my youth\
      Remember not \
      The sins of my youth

      Teach me thy paths\
      Thy ways, O Lord\
      Teach me thy paths\
      Thy ways, O Lord
  - song: |-
      We need you now\
      We need your fire within\
      We need your love\
      We need you as our friend\
      We need your light\
      To guide through what's ahead\
      We need you now\
      We need you now

      The Spirit's fire,\
      Almighty flame\
      Calling us higher,\
      Never the same\
      Burn in our hearts\
      Flow through our veins\
      The Spirit's fire,\
      The Spirit's fire.

      Your power made\
      This universe we see\
      Your power saved\
      Our lives and set us free\
      Your power's here \
      Among us as we sing\
      You're everything\
      You're everything

      Give us your fire\
      To carry us along\
      Give us desire\
      To build the kingdom strong\
      Give us the dream\
      And when the dream is done\
      We'll be with you\
      We'll be with you
  - song: |-
      Lord I'm a hard fighting soldier\
      On the battlefield\
      Lord I'm a hard fighting soldier\
      On the battlefield\
      Lord I'm a hard fighting soldier\
      On the battlefield\
      Keep on bringing souls to Jesus by the service that I yield

      I've got a helmet on my head\
      And in my hand a sword and shield\
      I've got a helmet on my head\
      And in my hand a sword and shield\
      I've got a helmet on my head\
      And in my hand a sword and shield\
      Keep on bringing souls to Jesus\
      By the service that I yield

      You've gotta walk right and talk right\
      And sing right and pray right on the battlefield\
      You've gotta walk right and talk right\
      And sing right and pray right on the battlefield\
      You've gotta walk right and talk right\
      And sing right and pray right on the battlefield\
      Keep on bringing souls to Jesus\
      By the service that I yield

      You know that Jesus is my captain\
      And He fights my battles still\
      He has never lost a battle\
      And I know He never will\
      I got the word for my sword\
      And I got faith for my shield\
      Keep on bringing souls to Jesus\
      By the service that I yield

      And when I did let me die\
      In the service of the Lord\
      And when I did let me die\
      In the service of the Lord\
      And when I did let me die\
      In the service of the Lord\
      Keep on bringing souls to Jesus\
      By the service that I yield

Amazing grace how sweet the sound\
I once was lost but now I′m found\
I once was blind but now I see\
I've got to share what you′ve done for me\
Turned my darkness in to light\
You turned my blindness in to sight\
I can't help speaking to the world\
Of what I've seen and heard

A faithful witness is what You′re seeking\
I can't help speaking what You′ve done for me\
Of all You gave me\
Of how You saved me\
A faithful witness I will be

My hope is built on nothing less\
Than Jesus′ blood and righteousness\
On Christ the solid rock I stand\
All other ground is sinking sand\
I′ll live my life so others know\
The choices that I make will show\
That I've been giv′n eternal life\
It's worth all sacrifice

I took my savior's hand\
He showed He had a plan\
To snatch me from the flame\
And give me a new name\
Though I'd been trapped in sin\
My life begun again\
Now that I′ve been set free\
He′s calling me to be
